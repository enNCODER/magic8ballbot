Welcome to my Magic 8 Ball Bot\
\
With this bot you can get the answers from a real magic 8 ball (I got
them all from my own) on your favorite chatting app. Just type in !shake
at any time to get a random response.\
List of all the responses can be viewed
[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGhCCvhx6LNLHRR4VpjwM8l47b4gqgbP0X298pHDBNk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1597182211880000&usg=AOvVaw2GWOMRxMLu2ropol_kwYEc).\
If you would like to host the bot yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597182211880000&usg=AOvVaw2VPdj-8gq7RrUyrIqjry5K) and
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597182211881000&usg=AOvVaw2_86Am5HzaX6Dqn0RuSwJ8) installed.
I would also recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597182211881000&usg=AOvVaw0-aMulqnalpHE-iOh6XMss) to
use as your code editor. Make sure before you host it to change
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client Secret”
to “client.login('your-token-goes-here');” in bot.js. (but replace
“your-token-goes-here” with the bot token but don’t get rid of the two '
symbols at the beginning and end of the text)\
