Welcome to my Magic 8 Ball Bot\
\
With this bot you can get the answers from a real magic 8 ball (I got
them all from my own) on your favorite chatting app. Just type in !shake
at any time to get a random response.\
You can also DM the bot at any time with the command and it will give
you the answer there instead of in the server.\
List of all the responses can be viewed
[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGhCCvhx6LNLHRR4VpjwM8l47b4gqgbP0X298pHDBNk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1597187896904000&usg=AOvVaw38TvlIgaUuq1dWd9wmL4oq).\
If you would like to host the bot yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597187896905000&usg=AOvVaw14TT2sE8Al1Y5PHAEK9-q1) and
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597187896905000&usg=AOvVaw1oETRgg8RC3IIkN4ymMuBZ) installed.
I would also recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597187896905000&usg=AOvVaw2W68R02aa32R8WxtpVvBe0) to
use as your code editor. Make sure before you host it to change
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client Secret”
to “client.login('your-token-goes-here');” in bot.js. (but replace
“your-token-goes-here” with the bot token but don’t get rid of the two '
symbols at the beginning and end of the text)\
